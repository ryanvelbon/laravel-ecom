This is a generic eCommerce website built on Laravel.

Partially influenced by https://github.com/easylearningbd/laravelecommerce

This project is essentially a backend boilerplate for eCommerce projects. There is as little styling as possible - most of which is to be overridden/deleted.

# SHOPPING CART

This app includes a custom cart rather than integrating with a 3rd party solution such as Snipcart which would eat into our shop's profits.
